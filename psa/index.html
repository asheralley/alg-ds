        <h2>Introduction to problem solving</h2>
        <h3>Understand the problem</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Can I restate the problem in my own words?</li>
            <li>What are the inputs that go into the problem?</li>
            <li>
                What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the
                problem?
            </li>
            <li>
                Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do
                i have enough information to solve the problem?
            </li>
            <li>
                How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part
                of the problem
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Concrete Examples</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Coming up with examples can help you understand the problem
                better
            </li>
            <li>
                Examples also procide sanity checks that your eventual solution
                works how it should

        <h4>Explore examples</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Start with simple examples</li>
            <li>Progress to More complex examples</li>
            <li>Explore examples with empty inputs</li>
            <li>Explore examples with invalid inputs</li>
